# --- Debug Harness for a Julia Function ---
#
# This script provides a clean, isolated environment to debug a single Julia function.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Paste the function you want to debug in the "Function to Debug" section.
#    If it relies on other helper functions, paste them there as well.
#
# 2. If your function uses any modules (e.g., DataFrames, LinearAlgebra), add the
#    necessary `using <ModuleName>` statements in the "Dependencies" section.
#
# 3. In the "Probing Area" at the bottom, write code to call your function.
#    Use different inputs to test various scenarios, especially the ones causing issues.
#    The `@show` macro is great for printing both the expression and its result.
#
# 4. Run this file from your terminal to see the output:
#    julia debug_harness.jl
#

# --- 1. Dependencies ---
# Add any `using` statements your function needs here.
# Example:
# using DataFrames


# --- 2. Function to Debug ---
# Paste the function(s) you want to isolate and test here.

# Example:
# function my_buggy_function(x, y)
#     # some complex logic that might fail
#     result = x / y
#     return result
# end


# --- 3. Probing Area ---
# Call your function with various inputs to see how it behaves.

# Example calls:
# try
#     println("Testing with valid inputs (10, 2):")
#     result1 = my_buggy_function(10, 2)
#     @show result1
#
#     println("\nTesting with edge case inputs (10, 0):")
#     result2 = my_buggy_function(10, 0)
#     @show result2
# catch e
#     println("\nCaught an error: ", e)
# end
