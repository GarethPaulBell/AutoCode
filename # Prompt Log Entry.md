# Clean up repository

Date: 2025-08-30 16:51:24

## ðŸŸ¢ Observations
- When we created the new branch, we created a new virtual environment
- However, this did not contain the necessary libs, so these were installed using pip
- We tried using the incorrect command to install ell, and then adjusted a bunch of code to make the library not dependent on it

## ðŸŸ  Orientation
- We need to install ell using the correct command and redo the cleanup
- Confidence: Medium

## ðŸ”µ Instructions
- Create a new branch called cleanup
- Switch to the branch
- Create a new venv
- All dependencies apart from ell can be installed via pip using standard commands
- Use the following command for ell: pip install -U "ell-ai[all]"
- Now bring the files forward from workspace as before
- Test the new files to make sure everything is working correctly
- DO NOT make major changes to the code if there are any dependencies missing.

ðŸŽ‰ Current Status
âœ… AI function generation works perfectly
âœ… Generated test cases are automatically stored and executable
âœ… Semantic search finds functions with proper similarity scoring
âœ… All functions have working, passing tests
âœ… Database operations are fully functional

# Prompt Log Entry

Date: 2025-08-30 17:12:13

## ðŸŸ¢ Observations
- I am not sure if all functionality is covered in the tests

## ðŸŸ  Orientation
- Elle and Julia parsers are tested, but more perhaps move coverage is required. Also current tests do not delete test entries after running


## ðŸ”µ Instructions
- Make sure test entries are deleted after running tests
- Check to make sure test coverage is accurate

---

## âœ… Result
- Summary of AI/tool response
- Correct first time: Y/N
- Iteration count: 1

## ðŸ§­ Reflection
- What was missing in Orientation/Instruction?
- Next tweak to improve prompt
