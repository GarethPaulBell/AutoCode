## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based code management system for Julia designed to streamline the process of managing code snippets, unit testing, and tracking modifications. It provides the ability to create functions, add unit tests, execute those tests, and log modifications to code with versioning and result tracking.

### Key Features
- **Function Management:** Easily create, store, and modify code snippets with metadata like name, description, and timestamps.
- **Unit Testing:** Associate unit tests with functions. These tests are automatically executed, and results are tracked with detailed statuses (Passed, Failed, etc.).
- **Modification Logging:** Track all modifications to the code, including details about who modified it, when, and the nature of the changes.
- **Test Results:** Logs the outcome of unit tests for further analysis, including execution dates and statuses.
