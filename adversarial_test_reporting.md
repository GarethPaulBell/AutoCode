# Adversarial/Edge Case Test Reporting (2025-09-13)

## Robustness Validation Results

- **Failing tests**: Correctly reported as failed, with error details.
- **Skipped tests**: Julia's `@test_skip` macro is accepted, but the reporting system currently marks these as "Passed". They should be reported as "Skipped" or "Broken" for clarity. (See [Julia Test.jl docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/#Base.Test.@test_skip))
- **Large test suites**: Reporting remains clear and readable with many tests.
- **Broken/malformed tests**: Correctly reported as failed, with error details.

## Recommendations

- **Improve skipped/broken test reporting**: Update the test result parsing logic to recognize and display "Skipped"/"Broken" results from Julia's test macros, not just "Passed"/"Failed"/"Errored".
- **Edge case coverage**: The reporting system is robust for failures, errors, and large suites, but needs refinement for skipped/broken cases.

## Example (2025-09-13)

```julia
@test_skip 2 + 2 == 5  # Should be reported as Skipped/Broken, not Passed
@test 1 == 2           # Should be reported as Failed
```

## Next Steps

- Refine test result parsing to distinguish all Julia test result types.
- Add more adversarial/broken/skip test cases to the test suite for ongoing validation.
